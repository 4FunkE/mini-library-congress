# Mini Library of Congress

In this Mini Project, I am working with a bunch of collaborative colleagues, to where we can build a functioning library with intuative reponses such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br>
The end result will provide users with access to vast amounts of resources available throughout the Library of Congress

## Instructions

The completed application should meet the following criteria:

- As a user, I can submit a search query from the application to request data and receive a response from the Library of Congress.

- As a user, I can either perform a generic search for data in all formats or I can select a format in the form to help filter results.

- As a user, I can see all of the results of my search displayed on a separate page.

- As a user, I can conduct additional searches from the results page as well.
