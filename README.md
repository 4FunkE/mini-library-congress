# Mini Library of Congress

In this Mini Project, I am working with a bunch of collaborative colleagues, to where we can build a functioning library with intuative reponses such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br>
The end result will provide users with access to vast amounts of resources available throughout the Library of Congress
